How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Diff provided me a view of all the changes that have been done to the original file and the new file which has brought the bug to light.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You could keep the audit trial of what has been done with the file and be able to revert to a version is very much beneficial.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

You can track and determine when the commit should happen as opposed to how and when the auto save/commit happens with google docs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In a team based environment, working on multiple projects, each developer might be working on more than one file at a time and being able to save multiple files helps.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

same way the diff command works to view the history of the file/files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

you could always revert back to en existing working version if there are any issues with the current version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version control and a lot more. branching, merging etc.,
